<h1>The Best Movies According to Alvaro</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3>All the President's Men (1976)</h3>
<p>This is one of my favourite movies. 
    In the early 1970s, Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward 
    and Carl Bernstein uncover the Watergate scandal - a conspiracy 
    to cover up abuses of power leading all the way to the Oval 
    Office and eventually to the resignation of President 
    Richard Nixon.</p>

<h3>Blade Runner (1982)</h3>
<p>This is one of my science fiction movies. A blade runner must 
    pursue and terminate four replicants who stole a ship in space 
    and have returned to Earth to find their creator.</p>

<h3>Un c≈ìur en hiver (1992)</h3> 
<p>This is one of my favourite French movie. Provocative story about 
    two violin craftsmen (Daniel Auteuil, Andre Dussolier) whose partnership 
    is threatened by an alluring young musician (Emmanuelle Beart).</p>
